    i have created a simple React app and connected it with a simple Node/Express API 
    The objective here is to give you a practical guide on how to set up and connect 
    the front-end client and the back-end server.


The key to connect the frontend with the backend is the proxy
  "proxy":"http://localhost:5000"
which added on package.json for the client folder


 Packages Used 
---
      React             create-react-app client

      Node/Express       npm i express

      nodemon             npm i nodemon

      concurrently        npm i concurrently

<br/>
<p>Concurrently is used to run more than one command from one script so it runs the "node server" and the 
react front from one command </p>
